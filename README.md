# Welcome to JSON LOCAL CRUD - Prototype Wizard

Hello! This small guide will help you understand what the JSON CRUD Prototype Wizard is and why it is so useful, even though it is just a small file.

## What is JSON?

Imagine JSON as a notebook where you write information in a very organized way. For example, if you have a shopping list, you note down what you need to buy and maybe some extra details like the quantity of each item. JSON is a way of writing these lists on a computer so that programs and websites can easily read and understand them.

### The problem with JSON

JSON uses a specific format with curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, commas `,`, and quotation marks `""`. This can be tricky to write and edit in a text editor, especially when the data is large or complex. For instance, if you forget a comma or close a brace incorrectly, the entire JSON can become invalid and hard to understand.

### The challenge of creating a CRUD system

Developing a complete system to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data can be time-consuming and complex, especially for those not familiar with programming. Even if there are ready-made systems available, they often require various configurations to adapt them to the specific needs of a project.

## How does the JSON CRUD Prototype Wizard help?

Even though it is a small file that you can use on your computer without installing anything complicated, the JSON CRUD Prototype Wizard is very powerful. It helps people who are planning to create something bigger, like a website or a system, to test their ideas quickly.
